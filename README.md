Chatbot Project: RoboReps Workout and Recipe Chatbot

This project is a chatbot program designed to provide users with custom workouts, recipe ideas, and instant workout generation. The inspiration for this project comes from the content creator Tina Huang, who inspired me with a similar project tutorial.

The chatbot utilizes OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities and is deployed as a Flask API, allowing users to interact with it through a web interface or API requests.

Features
Custom Workout Plans: Users can receive personalized workout plan designed based on their fitness goals, preferences, and available equipment.

Recipe Ideas: The chatbot provides users with recipe suggestions tailored to their dietary preferences, restrictions, and culinary interests.

Instant Workouts: Users can generate quick, on-the-go workout routines based on their desired intensity level and time constraints.

Technologies Used
OpenAI: The chatbot leverages OpenAI's natural language processing models to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses.

Flask: The chatbot is deployed as a Flask API, allowing for easy interaction via HTTP requests.

Python: The backend logic of the chatbot is implemented using Python, including data processing, generation of workout routines, and recipe suggestions.

Usage
To interact with the chatbot, you can use the provided web interface or make HTTP requests to the deployed Flask API. Below are the endpoints available for interaction:

/custom-workout: Generate a custom workout routine by providing your fitness goals, preferences, and available equipment.

/recipe-ideas: Get recipe suggestions based on your dietary preferences, restrictions, and culinary interests.

/instant-workout: Generate a quick, on-the-go workout routine by specifying your desired intensity level and time constraints.

Deployment
